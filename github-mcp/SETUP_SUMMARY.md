# Complete Setup Guide: Qwen Code + GitHub MCP Server

This document provides a complete summary of the setup to connect Qwen Code with GitHub using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

## Overview

We have successfully set up the infrastructure to connect Qwen Code to GitHub through the GitHub MCP Server, enabling:
- Repository management and code browsing
- Issue and pull request automation
- CI/CD workflow monitoring
- Code analysis capabilities
- Team collaboration tools

## Files Created

1. `github-mcp-config.json` - Basic configuration for Qwen Code MCP integration
2. `github-mcp-config-full.json` - Extended configuration with additional toolsets
3. `QWEN_CODE_MCP_SETUP.md` - Complete setup instructions
4. `test-mcp-connection.sh` - Test script to verify the setup

## Setup Summary

### 1. Prerequisites Verified
- ✅ Docker is installed and running (version 28.4.0)
- ✅ GitHub MCP Server Docker image pulled successfully
- ✅ System ready for MCP integration

### 2. Configuration Files Created
- Basic configuration with default toolsets
- Extended configuration with additional capabilities:
  - Repository tools
  - Issue management
  - Pull request handling
  - Actions/CI-CD operations
  - Code security tools
  - User management

### 3. Integration Ready
- Docker container properly configured
- Environment variables set up for secure token handling
- Toolset configuration included for optimal functionality

## Next Steps

To complete the integration:

1. **Create your GitHub Personal Access Token** with appropriate permissions (repo, read:org, read:packages)

2. **Configure Qwen Code** with one of our configuration files:
   - Use `github-mcp-config.json` for basic functionality
   - Use `github-mcp-config-full.json` for extended capabilities

3. **Test the connection** by asking Qwen Code to perform GitHub operations like:
   - Reading repository contents
   - Creating or updating issues
   - Checking CI/CD status
   - Managing pull requests

## Security Considerations

- Store your GitHub PAT securely and never commit it to version control
- Use environment variables when possible
- Grant only necessary permissions to your PAT
- Regularly rotate your tokens

## Troubleshooting

- If Docker isn't running: `sudo systemctl start docker`
- If you have permission issues with Docker: Add your user to the docker group
- Verify the MCP server is properly configured in Qwen Code settings

## Conclusion

You now have a complete setup to connect Qwen Code with GitHub through the MCP protocol. The system is ready to enable natural language interactions with your GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and CI/CD workflows.
