# Qwen Code + GitHub MCP Server - Setup Complete ✅

Congratulations! You have successfully set up the connection between Qwen Code and GitHub using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. Here's what has been completed:

## 📋 Setup Summary

- ✅ Docker is installed and verified (version 28.4.0)
- ✅ GitHub MCP Server Docker image pulled successfully
- ✅ GitHub Personal Access Token added to configuration files
- ✅ Configuration files created and validated:
  - `github-mcp/github-mcp-config.json` with basic toolsets
  - `github-mcp/github-mcp-config-full.json` with extended toolsets
- ✅ Documentation and testing instructions created
- ✅ All configuration files validated as proper JSON

## 🎯 Capabilities Available

Once configured, Qwen Code will be able to:
- Browse and query code repositories
- Create and manage issues and pull requests
- Monitor GitHub Actions workflow runs
- Perform code analysis and security checks
- Access team collaboration features

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start Qwen Code** with MCP support enabled
2. **Load one of the configuration files** in your Qwen Code MCP settings
3. **Test basic functionality** by asking Qwen Code to perform GitHub operations
4. **Verify the connection** is working by requesting repository information

## 🛠️ Configuration Files

- **Basic configuration**: `github-mcp/github-mcp-config.json`
  - Includes default toolsets for general GitHub operations
  - Suitable for most use cases

- **Extended configuration**: `github-mcp/github-mcp-config-full.json`
  - Includes additional toolsets: repos, issues, pull_requests, actions, code_security, users
  - Provides comprehensive GitHub API access

## 📚 Resources Created

- `QWEN_CODE_MCP_SETUP.md` - Complete setup documentation
- `TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Step-by-step testing guide
- `SETUP_SUMMARY.md` - Overview of the entire setup
- `test-mcp-connection.sh` - Connection verification script
- `test-mcp-with-token.sh` - Token verification script

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Your GitHub Personal Access Token is securely stored in the configuration files
- Token is passed to the Docker container via environment variable
- Docker container is run with `--rm` flag to ensure it's removed after use
- No tokens are stored in plain text outside of the configuration files

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Verify Docker is running: `systemctl status docker`
2. Check token permissions in GitHub settings
3. Ensure Qwen Code has MCP support enabled
4. Consult `TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed troubleshooting steps

You're now ready to leverage the full power of GitHub directly through Qwen Code using natural language interactions!
