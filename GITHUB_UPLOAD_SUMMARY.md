# AutoResearch Workflow - GitHub Upload Complete

## Overview
You have successfully prepared your local repository for upload to GitHub. The following steps have been completed:

1. ✅ Initialized a Git repository in `/media/user/B29202FA9202C2B91/AutoReaserch-workflow`
2. ✅ Configured .gitignore to protect sensitive files containing tokens
3. ✅ Created configuration templates without tokens for sharing
4. ✅ Committed all necessary files to the local repository
5. ✅ Prepared detailed instructions for uploading to GitHub

## Files Protected from Upload
The following files contain sensitive information and are excluded by .gitignore:
- `github-mcp/github-mcp-config.json`
- `github-mcp/github-mcp-config-full.json`

## Files to be Uploaded
The following files will be uploaded to your private GitHub repository:
- All documentation files (README.md, SETUP_SUMMARY.md, etc.)
- Configuration templates without tokens:
  - `github-mcp/github-mcp-config-template.json`
  - `github-mcp/github-mcp-config-full-template.json`
- All script files
- The .gitignore file itself

## Next Steps
To complete the upload to your private GitHub repository:

1. Follow the instructions in `PUSH_TO_GITHUB_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
2. Create a private repository on GitHub
3. Push your local repository to GitHub using the commands provided

## Security Notes
- Your GitHub Personal Access Token remains secure and is not included in the repository
- Users who clone the repository will need to add their own tokens to the configuration templates
- The configuration templates provide placeholders for tokens using the ${input:github_token} pattern

Your repository is now ready to be pushed to GitHub as a private repository. The sensitive token information is protected while all other documentation and configuration templates are available for sharing.
